# 🌐 REPO_FQDN: The primary domain for the RPM Repository.
# 1. Used by 'rpmrepo' (Apache) to set ServerName and SSL paths.
# 2. MUST exist in 'certbot/certificates.csv' for automated LE issuance.
# 3. Used by 'client-test' to resolve the repository location.
REPO_FQDN=repo.mydatacenter.io

# 🛡️  CA_NAME: The "Common Name" (CN) for your internal Client-Auth Root CA.
# This name appears in the system trust store on Linux clients.
# NOTE: Avoid special characters; keep it descriptive for 'trust list' logs.
CA_NAME="Internal-RPM-Repo-CA"

# 👤 CLIENT_NAME: The identity/filename for the test client certificate.
# In production, this is typically overridden by the host's actual hostname.
CLIENT_NAME="client-identity"

# ==============================================================================
# ⚠️  MAINTENANCE NOTES:
# - Changes to REPO_FQDN require a 'docker compose restart' and cert renewal.
# - Ensure secrets/rpmrepo-secrets/certificate/generate_mtls_client_ca.sh is run 
#   after changing CA_NAME or CLIENT_NAME to sync the PKI material.
