# 🛠️ AUTOMATED CERTBOT DNS-01 MANAGER (ALMALINUX)
#
# WHAT IS THIS?
# This container is a "Certificate Factory." It talks to Let's Encrypt to get
# SSL certificates for your domains and then automatically packages them into
# an RPM file so they can be installed on other Linux servers like any other software.
#
# 📋 HOW TO USE THIS:
#
# 1. SETUP THE LIST (certificates.csv):
#    Create a simple text file named 'certificates.csv'. Each line should look like this:
#    fqdn,dns_provider,email
#    repo.example.com,cloudflare,admin@example.com
#
# 2. PROVIDE THE KEYS (.ini files):
#    If you use 'cloudflare' in the list above, you MUST provide a file named
#    'cloudflare.ini' containing your API keys.
#    Place this in your mounted /etc/letsencrypt/secrets/ folder.
#
# 3. SET PERMISSIONS (Crucial!):
#    Certbot is picky about security. On your host machine, run:
#    chown root:root /etc/letsencrypt/secrets/*.ini
#    chmod 600 /etc/letsencrypt/secrets/*.ini
#
# ⚙️ HOW IT WORKS (The Pipeline):
#    - [The Manager]: 'certbot_manager.py' reads your CSV and requests the certs.
#    - [The Packer]: Once the cert is issued, 'cert2rpm.sh' is triggered automatically.
#    - [The RPM]: A .rpm file is built containing the cert and its private key.
#    - [The Hand-off]: The RPM is moved to /rpms/ for distribution to Linux clients.
#
# 📦 DISTRIBUTION:
#    This container saves certificates in /etc/letsencrypt/live/ for local use.
#    However, it also drops a finished RPM into the /rpms/ directory.
#    If you run a 'repo' container alongside this one, it will detect the new RPM
#    and allow your clients to 'dnf install' it.
#
#    When a client installs the RPM, the files land in these standard locations:
#    - Public Cert:  /etc/pki/tls/certs/
#    - Private Key:  /etc/pki/tls/private/
#    - Trust Anchor: /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/ (Enables OS-wide trust)
#
# ⚠️ SECURITY NOTE:
#    The container runs as ROOT. This is required to build RPMs and manage
#    system-level security folders and permissions.
